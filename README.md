In this project I built a trivia game. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a simple trivia asking questions about skiing. Keeping track of the score and diplaying the results with a modal.

## User Stories
While building code I used a modal to display the questions once the start game button (TAKE ME TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN) was clicked. Finally each question has a series of answers seperated with either an answers1 class or wrong class to distinguish the correct anser and set up a way to eventually keep score. At the last question all the answers choices send you to the results page. Where depending on your score a string of text will be displayed. 

While building this program some issues I ran into were the last answer event sent me to results page before updating score this was fixed with a last button function event listener. This updates the score before the seeResults function is ran. 

Other issues I ran into with this project were it was built desktop first not mobile first so while playing on a mobile it does not look as great.

Finally this was all built out of a repo in GitHub Enterprise and later transferred to my personal GitHub account therefore the commits along the way are not present. you can see them here [https://git.generalassemb.ly/10jferzacca/Project-1--Trivia-Game/commits/master]
